Recommender systems can suffer from data sparsity and cold start issues. However, social
networks, which enable users to build relationships and create different types of items, present an
unprecedented opportunity to alleviate these issues. In this paper, we represent a social network as a starstructured hybrid graph centered on a social domain, which connects with other item domains. With this
innovative representation, useful knowledge from an auxiliary domain can be transferred through the
social domain to a target domain. Various factors of item transferability, including popularity and
behavioral consistency, are determined. We propose a novel Hybrid Random Walk (HRW) method, which
incorporates such factors, to select transferable items in auxiliary domains, bridge cross-domain
knowledge with the social domain, and accurately predict user-item links in a target domain. Extensive
experiments on a real social dataset demonstrate that HRW significantly outperforms existing approaches.
