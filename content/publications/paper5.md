Cluster analysis is one of the prominent techniques in the field of data mining and k-means is
one of the most well known popular and partitioned based clustering algorithms. K-means clustering
algorithm is widely used in clustering. The performance of k-means algorithm will affect when clustering
the continuous data.
In this paper, a novel approach for performing k-means clustering on continuous data is proposed. It
organizes all the continuous data sets in a sorted structure such that one can find all the data sets which
are closest to a given centroid efficiently. The key institution behind this approach is calculating the
distance from origin to each data point in the data set. The data sets are portioned into k-equal number of
cluster with initial centroids and these are updated all at a time with closest one according to newly
calculated distances from the data set.
The experimental results demonstrate that proposed approach can improves the computational speed
of the direct k-means algorithm in the total number of distance calculations and the overall time of
computations particularly in handling continuous data.
